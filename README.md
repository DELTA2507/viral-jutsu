# ViralJutsu Game Manual

## 🎮 Casual Mode – Game Guide

### 🕹️ How to Play
In **Casual Mode**, you must slice the icons that appear on screen by moving your mouse or touching the screen.

- Hold down the click (or your finger on mobile) to **activate the katana**.  
- Swipe across an icon to **slice it in half**.  
- The more consecutive slices you make, the more **points and combos** you earn.  

---

### 📊 Scoring
- Each **good** object gives **10 base points**.  
- Each consecutive slice triggers a **combo**: each cut increases the multiplier (+50% extra per slice).  
- Cutting objects also adds **extra time** to the timer.  

Example:  
- 1st slice → 10 points  
- 2nd slice in combo → 15 points  
- 3rd slice in combo → 20 points  
- etc.  

Additionally:  
- An active combo accumulates **Combo Time**, which is saved in your final stats.  

---

### ⏱️ Timer
- You start with **60 seconds**.  
- Cutting good objects adds **+5 seconds**.  
- Hitting hazard objects removes **-10 seconds**.  
- The timer never goes below **0**.  

---

### ❌ Fail Conditions
- If a good object falls unsliced → you accumulate **1 fail**.  
- If you slice a hazard without a shield → you accumulate **1 fail** and lose **-10 seconds**.
- You can only accumulate **3 fails in total** before losing.

Reaching 3 fails → **Game Over**.

### ⚡ Power-Ups
**Power-ups** appear randomly and can be identified by their **green border**:  

- **Kunai Storm** 🌀  
  Automatically destroys all good objects on screen.  
  Grants points, time, and keeps your combo active.  

- **Shield** 🛡️  
  Protects you from fails and hazards for **10 seconds**.  

- **Slowmo** 🕒  
  Slows everything down for **5 seconds**.  
  Lets you slice with more precision.  

---

### 🖥️ Controls
- **Mouse / Touch** → Hold down and drag to slice.  
- **Space / Pause Button** → Pauses the game and opens the menu.

### 🎨 Visual Feedback
- When missing a **good** object, the screen shakes and the background flashes **bright orange** for one second.  
- When activating **Slowmo**, the background turns **purple**.  
- Each slice leaves a **dynamic white trail** that fades out.  
- Points and combos appear as **floating text**.  

---

### 🏁 End of Game
The game ends when:  
- Time reaches **0**, or  
- You accumulate **3 fails**, or  
- You pause and select **Exit**. 

On game over, your stats are displayed:
